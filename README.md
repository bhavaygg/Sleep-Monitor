# Sleep-Monitor


This clock has been modified to be able to calculate the time you spend in REM sleep which is the time where your body movement is minimal or basically nil.

For this project we have used a Motion Sensor and using an Arduino we collect the data. Further we used a Temperature and Humidity Sensor to provide the average tempwerature and humidity of the time one is in REM sleep. The collected data is send to your mobile device through bluetooth and displayed on a basic app made using MIT App Inventor.
